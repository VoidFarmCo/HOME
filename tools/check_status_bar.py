"""The status bar has two heights, and only some screens can afford the tall one.

Every feature screen in this firmware puts a toolbar immediately under the
status bar -- a survey of the drawing calls finds 74 with a literal y between
20 and 48, eleven of them at exactly 20. Those screens cannot give the bar a
single extra pixel without something being painted over.

The menu grids can: their first tile is at Y_START, which is
44, leaving 24 px of bar-coloured nothing. So the height is shared state set
by whichever function paints the screen, and the failure mode is a screen that
forgets to declare one and inherits a tall bar over its own toolbar.

That is what this checks. It reads source; it does not need a board.
